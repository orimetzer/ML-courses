# ML-courses
Two different home assignments given in Courses ML1 and ML2. 
1. Generalization, Overfit and Sentiment Analysis:
    Two parts for this exercise -
    The first is to demonstrate overfitting of labels using Bernoulli distribution, and applying fully connected and cross-entropy loss to it.
    The second involves getting familiar with recurrent neural networks and using Vanilla RNN and Gated model (GRU/LSTM).
2. KNN-classifier:
    The second exercise was to implement solely the KNN classifier algorithm, without using external libraries.
